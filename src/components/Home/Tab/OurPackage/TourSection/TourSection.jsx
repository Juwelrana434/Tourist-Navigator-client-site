            You should without a doubt go to Cox's Bazar, which is situated next
            to the seashore along the Bay of Bengal, if you're looking for the
            most well-known tourist destinations in Bangladesh. It features the
            longest uninterrupted sea beach in the world, which is more than 120
            kilometres long.

          shells, waterfalls, pagodas, and parks may also be found here. The
          main draw of Cox's Bazar is the enormous Buddhist monastery known as
          Aggmeda Khyang, which houses numerous massive bronze statues of
          Buddha.

            its location as a busy river port in the late 1800s, Sonargaon was a
            popular destination for muslin traders. Its numerous galleries and
            historical landmarks make it a popular tourist destination and add
            to its allure. A magnificent museum has been created in the old

            <br /> St. Martin's Island is the only coral island in Bangladesh.
            This island is referred to as "Narikel Zinzira" in Bengali, which
            translates to "Coconut Island," because it has an overabundance of
            coconut palms. 9 kilometres to the south of Coxs Bazar is the
            island.
