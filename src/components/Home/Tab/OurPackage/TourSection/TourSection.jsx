            lovely city of Sylhet in Bangladesh. It serves as the district and
            divisional headquarters for the districts of Sylhet, Moulvibazar,
            Habiganj, and Sunamganj. The picture-perfect city has all the
            elements of a dreamy fairy tale setting, including a picturesque
            harbour, grand views of the neighbouring mountain range, and vibrant
